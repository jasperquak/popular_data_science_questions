# Popular data science questions

In this study, we will analyze "What questions do people ask about Data science?" on StackExchange. 

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/clean_analyze_employee_exit_surveys/blob/main/CleanAnalyzeEmployeeExitSurveys.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and the .zip file. Unpack the .zip file and make sure that all .csv files are in the same folder as the .ipynb file.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn

## About the data sources

The data was extracted from [the Data Science Stack Exchange site](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/), which contains an option to extract data using SQL queries.

See the contents of the Notebook for more details about the data used.
